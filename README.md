this is an open broadcast network, community-driven, free tv & radio directory.

> [!NOTE]
> **disclaimer:** fonseware-cable is not a real physical cable service and is not meant to replace your actual cable or satellite television provider. it is simply the brand name of this community-driven iptv service.

the goal is to fill **200 channels** with original, independent, 24/7 (preferable) broadcast content. university television networks, community channels, and generic independent broadcasts are highly encouraged.

> [!WARNING]
> **content warning & parental controls:** this playlist is community-driven and may contain adult, nsfw, or unrated content. we strongly encourage users to use a playlist manager or a media player with parental controls (such as the channel management and locking features in kodi) to restrict access to certain channels if minors use the device.

> we are not a piracy index. do not submit iptv-org or similar links. do not submit pirated sports streams. they will be rejected, and you will be blocked. do not submit streams you found on the internet.

currently, all vacant channels point to a placeholder loop. when you submit a valid stream, you claim that channel number permanently (as long as your uptime remains stable).
