### The Open Broadcast Network of Sri Lanka (and beyond)

**fonseware-cable** is a community-driven, open-source IPTV directory. 

We are not a piracy index. We are a **Federated Broadcast Network**. We provide the EPG (Electronic Program Guide) and the channel numbers; **you** provide the signal.

Think of this as "Dialog TV" but free, decentralized, and run by the creators themselves.

## 📺 The Vision
The goal is to fill **200 channels** with original, independent, 24/7 broadcast content. 

* **Channel 001:** [FBS (Fonseware Broadcasting Service)](https://fonseware.com) - *Flagship*
* **Channel 002 - 200:** [VACANT] - *Waiting for YOU*

Currently, all vacant channels point to a placeholder loop. When you submit a valid stream, you claim that channel number permanently (as long as your uptime remains stable).
